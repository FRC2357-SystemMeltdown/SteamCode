/**
 * A {@link StateMachineCommand} is and alternative to {@link CommandGroup} that
 * implements a state machine (see the {@link State} interface). Each state has
 * a {@link StateCommand} to run when it is the current state and from each
 * state, the next state can be determined when current state's command is
 * finished ( {@link #isFinished()} returns true). The
 * {@link StateMachineCommand} ends when null is chosen for the next state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that if the current state's {@link StateCommand} implements the
 * {@link NextStateProvider} interface, it will be asked to provide the next
 * state; otherwise, the current {@link State} itself will provide the next
 * state.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike a {@link CommandGroup}, a {@link StateMachineCommand} does not carry
 * all the requirements of its contained commands. Only the requirements of the
 * command for the current state are in effect at any one time. The
 * {@link StateMachineCommand} itself must never require any {@link Subsystem}
 * instances.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you want to set a {@link StateMachineCommand} as the default command for a
 * {@link Subsystem}, see the {@link DefaultStateCommandWrapper} class. You MUST
 * wrap the subsystem default {@link StateCommand} in an instance of
 * {@link DefaultStateCommandWrapper} and set the wrapper as the default
 * command.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * While this class could allow any set of {@link State} implementations to
 * define the state machine, it was decided to enforce that it be an enumeration
 * that implements {@link State} so as to ensure that there is one place
 * available to find and understand the states and the state machine involved.
 * </p>
